q1
the simple threshold classifier for sentiment analysis described in the video (check all that apply):

TRUE : Must have pre-defined positive and negative attributes

TRUE : Must either count attributes equally or pre-define weights on attributes

FALSE : Defines a possibly non-linear decision boundary

---------------------------------------------------------
q2

For a linear classifier classifying between “positive” and “negative” sentiment in a review x, Score(x) = 0 implies (check all that apply):

FALSE : The review is very clearly “negative”

TRUE : We are uncertain whether the review is “positive” or “negative”

FALSE : We need to retrain our classifier because an error has occurred

NB: score of zero indicates the classifier was not able to classify as either positive or negative. uncertainty remains.

------------------------------------------------------------

q3

For which of the following datasets would a linear classifier perform perfectly?

ANSWER is the graph which allows classifier to separate with 100% accuracy with a straight line.

-----------------------------------------------------------

q4

True or false: High classification accuracy always indicates a good classifier.

FALSE : True

TRUE : False

Answer is 'false' because high classification accuracy can be the result of overfitting. An overfitted model can result in larger errors when new data considered.

-------------------------------------------------------------

q5
True or false: For a classifier classifying between 5 classes, there always exists a classifier with accuracy greater than 0.18.

True

False

minimum accuracy classifier is the coin flip (random choices), so minimum classifier accuracy is 1/k where k= number of classes.
thus minimum accuracy classifier will be 0.2

----------------------------------------------------------------
q6

True or false: A false negative is always worse than a false positive.

True

False

Ans: FALSE. Depends on the consequences of false-negative/false-positive.
ie: spam filter: false positive results in real email detected as SPAM and sent to spam folder. This is BAD.
Medical tests - if test does not detect life threatening disease, then patient may die due to no treatement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
q7
Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

TRUE : Test error tends to decrease with more training data until a point, and then does not change (i.e., curve flattens out)

FALSE : Test error always goes to 0 with an unboundedly large training dataset

FALSE : Test error is never a function of the amount of training data
