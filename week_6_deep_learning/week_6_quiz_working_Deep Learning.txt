1. 
Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

Linear classifiers are never useful, because they cannot represent XOR.

Linear classifiers are useful, because, with enough data, they can represent anything.

Having good non-linear features can allow us to learn very accurate linear classifiers.

none of the above

^ is false, Linear classifiers are useful for representing things other than XOR.

Linear classifiers are useful, because, with enough data, they can represent anything.
^ false, Linear classifiers cannot represent XOR so they cannot represent everything.(anything)

Having good non-linear features can allow us to learn very accurate linear classifiers.
^ TRUE. (wording should be 'can allow us to train very accurate linear classifiers')

none of the above
^ FALSE since item above is TRUE.
^^THIS IS CORRECT!!!!

A simple linear classifier can represent which of the following functions? (Check all that apply)

Hint: If you are stuck, see https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/module/nqC1t/discussions/AAIUurrtEeWGphLhfbPAyQ

TRUE : x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3

TRUE : x1 AND x2 AND NOT x3

TRUE : x1 OR (x2 AND NOT x3)

none of the above
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3 can be represented by y= 0.5 + x1 + x2 - x3
x1 AND x2 AND NOT x3 can be represented by y = -1.5 + X1 + X2 - X3
x1 OR (x2 AND NOT x3) - breaks into X1 or A where A = x2 AND NOT x3. Yes, can be done.
attempt 1 : first three are TRUE, 4th is FALSE.

3. 
Which of the the following neural networks can represent the following function? Select all that apply.

(x1 AND x2) OR (NOT x1 AND NOT x2)

4th answer is correct.
left   column parameters = -1.5, 1, 1
middle column parameters =  0.5, 1, 1
right  column parameters =  0.5, 1, 1

Which of the following statements is true? (Check all that apply)

TRUE : Features in computer vision act like local detectors.

FALSE : Deep learning has had impact in computer vision, because it’s used to combine all the different hand-created features that already exist.

TRUE : By learning non-linear features, neural networks have allowed us to automatically learn detectors for computer vision.

FALSE : none of the above

If you have lots of images of different types of plankton labeled with their species name, and lots of computational resources, what would you expect to perform better predictions:

ANSWER : a deep neural network trained on this data.

FALSE : a simple classifier trained on this data, using deep features as input, which were trained using ImageNet data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
given we have lots of classified images + lots of computational resources, don't need ImageNet data. will get better result when better qualified data is used instead of generic data.

If you have a few images of different types of plankton labeled with their species name, what would you expect to perform better predictions:

FALSE : a deep neural network trained on this data.

ANSWER : a simple classifier trained on this data, using deep features as input, which were trained using ImageNet data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
not enough images to train neural network on it's own, so use model trained on ImageNet data with simple classifier trained on the few images of plankton.
