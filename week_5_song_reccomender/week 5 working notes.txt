Cold start problem

Matrix Factorization Model

which algorythm is best?

for a given precision we want max recall.

plot precision on y axis, recall on horizontal axis/
area under the curve = AUC
when comparing we want curve with largest AUC.


Suppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in scenes from a video identifies 7 dogs in a scene containing 9 dogs and some cats. If 4 of the identifications are correct, but 3 are actually cats, the program's precision is 4/7 while its recall is 4/9.
