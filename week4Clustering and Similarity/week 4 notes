term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf

inverse document frequency
log (  # of docs / (1+# of docs using word) )

normalize vecotr = sqrt(sum of squares of vector elements)

common words 'the', 'player', 'goal'
rare words 'futbol', 'messi'

rare word - infrequent in corpus


bag of words model - different documents assessed as similar if have same words in content.
- ignores order of words
- counts frequency of word occurance.

long documents create a larger count of similar words. not a good example of similarity.

important word
- tradeoff between local frequency and global rarity.


rare words upweighted, common words downweighted.


find next document
- loop thru list of documents, calc similarity 
- if similarity > best_similarity_so_far then best_similarity_so_far=similarity
- repeat until all docs evaluated.
- return doc with best similarity.


clustering
- assess documents as vectors
- unsupervised learning task

k-means clustering
